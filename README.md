# Frunk Enum Support

[![Crates.io - frunk-enum](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/frunk-enum-core.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/frunk-enum-core) [![License: MIT/APACHE-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%2FAPACHE--2.0-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Usage

These crates augment the [frunk](https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/) crate to
allow transmogrification of `enum`s as well as `struct`s.  For more information
on transmogrification and the `LabelledGeneric` trait it's based around, see
https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/#transmogrifying and
https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/labelled/trait.LabelledGeneric.html.

To take advantage of this feature for your own enum you need to:

* Add the `frunk-enum-derive` as a `[dev-dependency]` to your `Cargo.toml`
* Mark the enum with the custom derive:

    ```
    #[derive(LabelledGenericEnum)]
    enum Foo {
        Bar(String),
        Baz { name: String, id: Identity },
    }
    ```
* Add the `frunk-enum-core` and `frunk-core` crates as `[depednency]` entries
  to your `Cargo.toml`
* Then (assuming there's a `NewFoo` enum with the same structure as `Foo`) you can write:

    ```
    let foo = Foo::Baz { name: "Andy".into(), id: Identity };
    let new_foo: NewFoo = foo.transmogrify();
    ```

This works by deriving an implementation of `LabelledGeneric` for `Foo` which
allows conversion to and from an instance of a generic sum-type.  The core
crate provides tools for converting between these generic sum-types where the
bodies of the variants are recursively transmogrifiable.  This allows for
arbitrarily deep conversion between types, especially useful where the two
types in question are autogenerated from some common input file, but are deemed
to be different types by the rust compiler (e.g. because they're in separate
crates).
